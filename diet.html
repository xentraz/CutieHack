        <h2>Importance of healthy diets</h2>
        <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nostrum quo
          laboriosam architecto ipsam veniam in repellendus, aliquid ea quaerat

          exercitationem voluptatem illum recusandae! Similique?
        </p>
        <span>Here are 5 diets that you should focus on:</span>
      </div>

      <div class="diet__main">
        <h2>1. Plant-based diets</h2>
        <p>
          Plant-based diets may help you lose weight. Vegetarianism and veganism
          are the most popular versions, which restrict animal products for
          health, ethical, and environmental reasons. <br />
          However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the
          flexitarian diet, which is a plant-based diet that allows eating
          animal products in moderation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> How it works: </span> There are
          many types of vegetarianism, but most involve eliminating all meat,
          poultry, and fish. Some vegetarians may likewise avoid eggs and dairy.
          The vegan diet takes it a step further by restricting all animal
          products, as well as animal-derived products like dairy, gelatin,
          honey, whey, casein, and albumin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Weight loss:</span> This pose is
          not recommended if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or other wrist
          problems, have high blood pressure or are in the late stages of
          pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Other benefits:</span> You can do
          the pose with your elbows on the ground, which takes the weight off
          your wrists. You can also use blocks under your hands, which may feel
          more comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Downsides:</span> Focus on
          distributing the weight evenly through your palms and lifting your
          hips up and back, away from your shoulders.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Low-carb diets</h2>
        <p>
          Low-carb diets are among the most popular diets for weight loss.
          Examples include the Atkins diet, ketogenic (keto) diet, and low-carb,
          high-fat (LCHF) diet. Some varieties reduce carbs more drastically
          than others. For instance, very-low-carb diets like the keto diet
          restrict this macronutrient to under 10% of total calories, compared
          with 30% or less for other types.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> How it works: </span> Low-carb
          diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat. They’re
          typically higher in protein than low-fat diets, which is important, as
          protein can help curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and
          conserve muscle mass. In very-low-carb diets like keto, your body
          begins using fatty acids rather than carbs for energy by converting
          them into ketones. This process is called ketosis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Weight loss:</span> Many studies
          indicate that low-carb diets can aid weight loss and may be more
          effective than conventional low-fat diets. For example, a review of 53
          studies including 68,128 participants found that low-carb diets
          resulted in significantly more weight loss than low-fat diets. What’s
          more, low-carb diets appear to be quite effective at burning harmful
          belly fat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Other benefits:</span> Research
          suggests that low-carb diets may reduce risk factors for heart
          disease, including high cholesterol and blood pressure levels. They
          may also improve blood sugar and insulin levels in people with type 2
          diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Downsides:</span> In some cases, a
          low-carb diet may raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Very-low-carb
          diets can also be difficult to follow and cause digestive upset in
          some people. In very rare situations, following a very-low-carb diet
          may cause a condition known as ketoacidosis, a dangerous metabolic
          condition that can be fatal if left untreated.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Low-fat diets</h2>
        <p>
          Like low-carb diets, low-fat diets have been popular for decades. In
          general, a low-fat diet involves restricting your fat intake to 30% of
          your daily calories. Some very- and ultra-low-fat diets aim to limit
          fat consumption to under 10% of calories.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> How it works: </span> Low-fat
          diets restrict fat intake because fat provides about twice the number
          of calories per gram, compared with the other two macronutrients —
          protein and carbs. Ultra-low-fat diets contain fewer than 10% of
          calories from fat, with approximately 80% of calories coming from
          carbs and 10% from protein. Ultra-low-fat diets are mainly plant-based
          and limit meat and animal products.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Weight loss:</span> An analysis of
          33 studies including over 73,500 participants found that following a
          low-fat diet led to small but relevant changes in weight and waist
          circumference. However, while low-fat diets appear to be as effective
          as low-carb diets for weight loss in controlled situations, low-carb
          diets seem to be more effective day to day. Ultra-low-fat diets have
          been shown to be successful, especially among people with obesity. For
          example, an 8-week study in 56 participants found that eating a diet
          comprising 7–14% fat led to an average weight loss of 14.8 pounds (6.7
          kg).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Other benefits:</span> Low-fat
          diets have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke.
          They may also reduce inflammation and improve markers of diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Downsides:</span> Restricting fat
          too much can lead to health problems in the long term, as fat plays a
          key role in hormone production, nutrient absorption, and cell health.
          Moreover, very-low-fat diets have been linked to a higher risk of
          metabolic syndrome.
        </p>

        <h2>4. The Mediterranean diet</h2>
        <p>
          The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like
          Italy and Greece used to eat. Though it was designed to lower heart
          disease risk, numerous studies indicate that it can also aid weight
          loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> How it works: </span> The
          Mediterranean diet advocates eating plenty of fruits, vegetables,
          nuts, seeds, legumes, tubers, whole grains, fish, seafood, and extra
          virgin olive oil. Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy products are
          to be eaten in moderation. Meanwhile, red meats are limited.
          Additionally, the Mediterranean diet restricts refined grains, trans
          fats, refined oils, processed meats, added sugar, and other highly
          processed foods.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Weight loss:</span> Though it’s not
          specifically a weight loss diet, many studies show that adopting a
          Mediterranean-style diet may aid weight loss. For example, an analysis
          of 19 studies found that people who combined the Mediterranean diet
          with exercise or calorie restriction lost an average of 8.8 pounds (4
          kg) more than those on a control diet
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Other benefits:</span> The
          Mediterranean diet encourages eating plenty of antioxidant-rich foods,
          which may help combat inflammation and oxidative stress by
          neutralizing free radicals. It has been linked to reduced risks of
          heart disease and premature death.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Downsides:</span> As the
          Mediterranean diet is not strictly a weight loss diet, people may not
          lose weight following it unless they also consume fewer calories.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Intermittent fasting</h2>
        <p>
          Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods
          of fasting and eating. Various forms exist, including the 16/8 method,
          which involves limiting your calorie intake to 8 hours per day, and
          the 5:2 method, which restricts your daily calorie intake to 500–600
          calories twice per week.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> How it works: </span> Intermittent
          fasting restricts the time you’re allowed to eat, which is a simple
          way to reduce your calorie intake. This can lead to weight loss —
          unless you compensate by eating too much food during allowed eating
          periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Weight loss:</span> In a review of
          studies, intermittent fasting was shown to cause 3–8% weight loss over
          3–24 weeks, which is a significantly greater percentage than other
          methods. The same review showed that this way of eating may reduce
          waist circumference by 4–7%, which is a marker for harmful belly fat.
          Other studies found that intermittent fasting can increase fat burning
          while preserving muscle mass, which can improve metabolism.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Other benefits:</span> Intermittent
          fasting has been linked to anti-aging effects, increased insulin
          sensitivity, improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and many
          other benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Downsides:</span> In general,
          intermittent fasting is safe for most healthy adults. That said, those
          sensitive to drops in their blood sugar levels, such as some people
          with diabetes, low weight, or an eating disorder, as well as pregnant
          or breastfeeding women, should talk to a health professional before
          starting intermittent fasting.
