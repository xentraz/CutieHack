      <div class="aerobics__main">
        <h2>1. Jumping Jacks</h2>
        <p>
          The Jumping jack is a total body exercise which primarily focuses on
          your quads. In lesser degrees, it also impacts your shoulders, abs,
          groin, calves, lower and upper back, hamstrings, and outer thighs.
          Stand straight with your feet together and hands alongside your
          thighs. Now, jump with your feet spread sideways and arms above your
          head simultaneously. Jump back to the normal position. 30 minutes of
          jumping jacks can help you shed 200 calories. However, doing it
          continuously could be a challenge and monotonous. Thus, break them
          into three sessions of 10 minutes each and get a 5-minutes rest in
          between.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Stair Training</h2>
        <p>
          This aerobic exercise primarily targets your calves, hamstrings,
          glutes, and quads. Apart from toning your lower body, it boosts the
          stamina of your cardiovascular system. Walk up and down the stairs for
          15–20 minutes at a steady pace. Gradually increase the time to 30
          minutes and your speed to a faster rate.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Butt Kicks</h2>
        <p>
          This exercise works on your hamstrings and glutes. Stand with your
          feet shoulder-width apart and bend your arms towards the sides. Bend
          your right knee like you are jogging and touch your butt with the
          right ankle. Repeat with the other leg. Keep the pace slow until you
          have perfected it. Complete 2 or 3, 30 second to 1-minute sets.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Burpees</h2>
        <p>
          Burpees are intense full-body exercises which increase your blood
          circulation, heart rate, strength, and flexibility. Stand with your
          feet shoulder-width apart and get into a squat position. Bend forward
          to place your palms in front of your feet and stretch your feet behind
          to get into a plank position. Immediately, return to the squat
          position and jump. Practice 3–5 sets of 8–15 repetitions each.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Squat Jacks</h2>
        <p>
          This exercise works great on your lower body and improves posture and
          stability. Stand with your feet together and hands alongside your
          thighs. Jump up and spread your feet while you settle into a squat
          position. Push through the heels and jump back up and return to the
          starting position. Do 1–2 sets of 8–15 repetitions each.
