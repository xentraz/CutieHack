        <h2>Yoga at home</h2>
        <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nostrum quo
          laboriosam architecto ipsam veniam in repellendus, aliquid ea quaerat
          praesentium consequuntur voluptatibus quia perspiciatis, quis,
          exercitationem voluptatem illum recusandae! Similique?
        </p>
        <span>Here are 5 exersizes you can do at home:</span>
      </div>

      <div class="yoga__main">
        <h2>1. Downward-Facing Dog</h2>
        <p>
          Downward-facing dog strengthens the arms, shoulders and back while
          stretching the hamstrings, calves and arches of your feet. It can also
          help relieve back pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> Do it: </span> To help relieve
          back pain. <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Skip it:</span> This pose is not
          recommended if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or other wrist
          problems, have high blood pressure or are in the late stages of
          pregnancy. <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Modify:</span> You can do the pose
          with your elbows on the ground, which takes the weight off your
          wrists. You can also use blocks under your hands, which may feel more
          comfortable. <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Be mindful:</span> Focus on
          distributing the weight evenly through your palms and lifting your
          hips up and back, away from your shoulders.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Plank Pose</h2>
        <p>
          A commonly seen exercise, plank helps build strength in the core,
          shoulders, arms and legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> Do it: </span> Plank pose is good
          if you are looking to tone your abs and build strength in your upper
          body. <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Skip it:</span> Avoid plank pose if
          you suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome. It can be hard on your wrists.
          You might also skip it or modify if you have low back pain. <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Modify:</span> You can modify it by
          placing your knees on the floor.<br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Be mindful:</span> As you do a
          plank, imagine the back of your neck and spine lengthening.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Four-Limbed Staff Pose</h2>
        <p>
          This push-up variation follows plank pose in a common yoga sequence
          known as the sun salutation. It is a good pose to learn if you want to
          eventually work on more advanced poses, such as arm balances or
          inversions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> Do it: </span>Like plank, this
          pose strengthens arms and wrists and tones the abdomen. <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Skip it:</span> If you have carpal
          tunnel syndrome, lower back pain, a shoulder injury or are pregnant.
          <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Modify:</span> It’s a good idea for
          beginners to modify the pose by keeping your knees on the floor.<br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Be mindful:</span> Press your palms
          evenly into the floor and lift your shoulders away from the floor as
          you hold this pose.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Tree Pose</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond helping improve your balance, it can also strengthen your core,
          ankles, calves, thighs and spine.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> Do it: </span>Great for working on
          your balance and posture. <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Skip it:</span> You many want to
          skip this pose if you have low blood pressure or any medical
          conditions that affect your balance.
          <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Modify:</span> Place one of your
          hands on a wall for support.<br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Be mindful:</span> Focus on your
          breath in and out as you hold this pose.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Triangle Pose</h2>
        <p>
          Triangle, which is a part of many yoga sequences helps build strength
          in the legs and stretches the hips, spine, chest, shoulders, groins,
          hamstrings and calves. It can also help increase mobility in the hips
          and neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="yoga__recommendation"> Do it: </span>This pose is great
          for building strength and endurance. <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Skip it:</span> Avoid this pose if
          you have a headache or low blood pressure.
          <br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Modify:</span> If you have high
          blood pressure, turn your head to gaze downward in the final pose. If
          you have neck problems, don’t turn your head to look upward; look
          straight ahead and keep both sides of the neck long.<br />
          <span class="yoga__recommendation">Be mindful:</span> Keep lifting
          your raised arm toward the ceiling. It helps keep the pose buoyant.
